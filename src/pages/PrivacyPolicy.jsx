      <ul>
        <li>To provide the information, services or support you request and related after-sales services;</li>
        <li>To identify you, and to contact you from time to time with product or service updates;</li>
        <li>To send other messages that help personalise our products and to make recommendations;</li>
        <li>To manage our relationship with you and to carry out any related administration;</li>
        <li>To promote our services, or the services of our suppliers, including by email and via social media platforms (subject to the relevant marketing permissions)*;</li>
        <li>To detect, investigate and prevent activity we think may be potentially illegal, unlawful or harmful and to enforce our Privacy Policy and/or our Terms or any other purpose referenced herein or therein*;</li>
        <li>To carry out research, including market research, statistical research on site traffic, sales and other commercial information to assist us in improving the services we provide to you and tailor the Site*;</li>
        <li>To allow us to troubleshoot the services we provide.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Who may use your information?</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>We may disclose your personal data to enforce our policies, to comply with our legal obligations or in the interests of security, public interest or law enforcement in any country where we have entities or affiliates. For example, we may respond to a request by a law enforcement agency or regulatory or governmental authority. We may also disclose data in connection with actual or proposed litigation, or to protect our property, security, people and other rights or interests.</li>
        <li>We share your information with third parties who help deliver our products and services to you. Examples include hosting our web servers, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. These companies will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not use that data for any other purpose.</li>
        <li>You may have accessed our website through a hyperlink from the website of one of our subsidiaries or trading partners. If so, you consent to your personal details and purchase information, including behavioural patterns, being shared with that trading partner in accordance with our contractual relationship with them.</li>
        <li>Please remember that when you share information publicly on any Fuse Network Limited website, for example, a comment on a blog post, it may be indexable by search engines, including Google, which may mean that the information is made public.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Third party links and services</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>The Site may contain links to third parties’ websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those websites. Therefore, please read carefully any privacy policies on those links or websites before either agreeing to their terms or using those websites.</li>
        <li>We also use Google Analytics to gather statistics on site usage. This may involve the use of cookies. There are more details in Google’s own privacy policy. Google may aggregate data they collect from their various services including Google Analytics, Google Translate, Google Maps and YouTube. You acknowledge and accept that we have no control over Google’s data collection. You should look at Google’s privacy policy for details of their data collection practices.</li>
        <li>If you have asked us to share data with third party sites (such as social media sites), their servers may not be secure.</li>
        <li>Note that, despite the measures taken by us and the third parties we engage, the internet is not secure. As a result, others may unlawfully intercept or access private transmissions or data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How do we protect your information?</h3>

      <p>We take what we consider to be appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to guard against unauthorised or unlawful processing of your personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by Fuse Network Limited reduce our vulnerability to security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We have security measures in place designed to protect our user database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains your responsibility where you have a client account for the Site:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>To keep your password or other access information secret. Your password and login details are personal to you and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access for example over a network. You should use a password which is unique to your use of the Site – do not use the same password as you use for another site or email account; and,</li>
        <li>To ensure no one else uses your details to log in to the Site while your device is logged on to the Site (including by logging on to your device through a mobile, Wi-Fi or shared access connection you are using);</li>
        <li>To log off or exit from Site when not using it;</li>
        <li>To maintain good internet security. For example, if your email account is compromised this could allow access to your account with us if you have given us those details and/or permitted access to those accounts. If your email account is compromised it could be used to ask us to reset a password and gain access to your account with us. You should keep all of your account details secure. If you think that any of your accounts has been compromised you should change your account credentials with us, and in particular, make sure any compromised account does not allow access to your account with us. You should also tell us as soon as you can so that we can try to help you keep your account secure and if necessary warn anyone else who could be affected.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Where is your information processed?</h3>

      <p>We might transfer your personal information to places outside Gibraltar for the purpose of providing you with the service you have requested. If you are in Gibraltar this means that your data may be transferred from Gibraltar to another country and stored there, where we (or our suppliers) might process it.</p>

      <p>If we transfer your personal data outside your country we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected in compliance with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p>Specific terms relating to Fuse Network Limited products</p>

      <p>Because of the way in which some of our products work we may need to process additional data, or process in a different way. If we need to, we will link to specific privacy policies relating to those products.</p>

      <h3>Marketing communications</h3>

      <p>If you have given permission, we may contact you by mail, telephone, SMS, text/picture/video message, and email about products, services, promotions and special offers that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive any direct marketing communications from us, you can opt out at any time. See further ‘Your rights’, below.</p>

      <h3>How long do we keep your information?</h3>

      <p>We will retain your personal data only as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, or as is required by applicable law, and then we will delete it.</p>

      <h3>Your rights</h3>

      <p>As explained above, you have the right to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us. If you wish to exercise your right to unsubscribe from email marketing communications, you can use the link at the bottom of any communications received from us. This will automatically suppress your email address from receiving future email marketing communications from our systems unless you choose to opt back in.</p>

      <p>If you wish to exercise your right to be removed from our telemarketing list, please let the caller know at the time of calling and they will make sure your number is suppressed unless you opt back in.</p>

      <p>In addition, to the extent permitted by the laws of your country, you may have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. If your objection is not to direct marketing in general but to direct marketing by a particular channel e.g. email or telephone, it would help us if you can specify the channel you are objecting to.</p>

      <p>Further, to the extent permitted by the laws of your country, you may also have the right to access, correct, delete, restrict, be forgotten, or object to the processing of, or request data portability of the personal data collected about you subject to some conditions and exceptions. You can find out more about these rights in Gibraltar by reading the General Data Protection Regulation here: https://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/legislations/regulation-eu-2016679-5582.</p>

      <p>We will take all reasonable steps to delete your personal data from our system(s) upon request unless restricted by law. We may keep a copy for as long as is necessary in our opinion, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In most cases, we will respond to any of your above-mentioned requests within one month but we reserve the right to verify your identity before dealing with your request.</p>

      <p>Data protection registration</p>

      <p>If you wish to inquire about or rely on any of these rights please send the details of your request by email to our Data Protection Officer Mikhail Nekrasov at mikhail@fuse.io.</p>

      <p>You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection regulator. Our lead regulator is the Gibraltar Regulatory authority who may be contacted at info@gra.gi or telephone: (+350) 20074636.</p>
